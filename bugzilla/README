CC List Manipulation
====================

Design Goals
------------

* Get the current CC list for a bug
* Set a cc list for a bug
* Save the lists used to set cc lists
* Delete an entry from the saved CC list
* Allow reuse of saved cc entries and lists
* Pass the lists in somewhat of a freehand
* Write a shell wrapper for basic operations and to hide the python/3.x behind it.

Implementation
--------------

* Use the BZ APIv1 for now as v2 is not out, yet. See 
* BZ bug handling docs:
    http://bugzilla.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/core/v1/bug.html#rest-single-bug
* request docs:
    http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/
* JSON docs:
